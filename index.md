A webring and website directory for people who include "meta" pages on their personal websites to share their websites and discover each other.

Do you have a `/meta` page or even a full-blown changelog? Consider [adding one](https://home.hedy.dev/posts/meta-pages/)!

## Can I join?

For the purposes of this directory and webring, in order to be included your site follow these requirements.

### Guidelines

1. It should be your personal site or personal blog, not a product or project page, not a company or organization page.
1. Your site should either have a dedicated page, such as `/meta` or `/colophon` that includes meta information, or a dedicated section in your about page or elsewhere that talks about your personal site in detail.

### Rules

1. Your site should not contain inappropriate content, including highly NSFW, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, or similar hateful material.
1. This webring and directory focuses on personal websites. This means product
   and project home pages will not be accepted.
