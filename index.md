*Welcome to the Meta Ring!*

This is a [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) for anyone who enjoys
tinkering and experimenting with their personal websites and writes about its
design and the technology in "meta" pages, or a colophon.

## What's this for?

> **colophon** (n.)
> <small>-- [en.wiktionary.org](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/colophon#Noun)</small><br/>
> A page on a website identifying the details of its creation, such as the
> author's name and the technologies used.

Your personal home page is unique. It is the result of careful craft and
deliberation and it represents a piece of you. You make intentional design
choices to reflect the values you believe in and how you see yourself, how you
wish to be perceived. You choose to use certain technologies that gets you
excited, or makes you productive, or simply ones that just "works" for your
use-case. You have built workflows and systems for and around producing content
on your personal pages, systems that works just for your own little corner of
the internet; and you write about all of this in a dedicated page on your very
own website and share it with others like you, who are also fascinated by the
cool and quirky personal web.

Do you have a `/meta` page or even a detailed changelog? Read about the [related
blog post](https://home.hedy.dev/posts/meta-pages/) or check out the [guidelines
below](#guidelines) for more context.

## Can I join?

Of course! Anyone with a personal website is welcome to join if the following
requirements are met.

### Guidelines

<ol>
  <li>

    Your website should either have a dedicated page, e.g. `/meta` or
    `/colophon`, or a dedicated section on your site elsewhere that talks about
    your personal site in detail.

    <details><summary>What should it be about?</summary>

    This could be anything you want to write about which you see fit -- what do
    you care a lot about on your personal site? Is it accessibility? Is it the
    fonts, the color scheme, or other aspects of design? Is it your blogging
    scripts, or did you hack together your own static-site generator to build
    your site from your own custom content format?

    Write about it, or link to those blog posts where you wrote about your
    site's updates!

    Check out some examples below in the [member list](#members), or in
    [this blog post](https://home.hedy.dev/posts/meta-pages/#examples).
    </details>
  </li>
  <li>

    The meta page or the page with the colophon section in question should be
    discoverable -- it should be linked where someone visiting your site from
    this webring can find.
  </li>
  <li>

    You should include the webring's previous and next links as provided
    [below](#webring-code) somewhere on your website. (That makes the "ring" in
    webrings!)

    <details><summary>Show details</summary>

    To allow members of the webring to be visited in a circuit, a visitor who
    came from the site before you in the webring, should be able to find the
    previous and next links and visit the next link in the webring.

    These links don't need to be on your home page, but like the meta page, it
    should be discoverable through your site navigation.
    </details>
  </li>
</ol>


### Rules

<ol>
  <li>

    Your site should not contain highly inappropriate, illegal, or immoral
    content, including pornographic, excessively NSFW, or similar material.
    Content warnings must be clearly visible.
  </li>

  <li>

    This webring focuses on **personal websites**. This means organization and
    project home pages will not be accepted.

    It's great to know about the technology behind your project sites, but the
    purpose of this webring is to encourage unique personal sites, the joy of
    exploration and tinkering with technology, reflecting it in your personal
    site, and sharing it with the world.
  </li>
</ol>

## How do I join?

Awesome! If you feel the [guidelines](#guidelines) above describes you, follow
these steps to add yourself to the webring:

1. Ensure your submission follows the [rules](#rules) listed above.

1. List the webring on your website. See [webring code](#webring-code) below for
